            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heretiques, becauſe they reject and diſobey the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholique Church. For it is not the matter or quality of the doctrine, but the pride of the man (who prefers his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions before the decrees of the

on which it relyes) is the revelation of God, and the propoſition of his Church. He therefore who beleeves not every particular Article of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Doctrine, which is revealed and propounded by Almighty God and his Church, (which Church is abſolutely infallible in all her propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls,) doth not aſſent to any one (even of thoſe which he beleeves) by divine faith; becauſe he aſſents not upon the onely true and infallible motiue. An aſſent not grounded on this, is no ſupernaturall divine faith, but onely an humane ſuſpicion, or opinion, or perſuaſion.

Yet the Miſtaker thinkes this may bee affirmed with Charitie. For <hi>it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the Catholique Church ſhould want Charity:</hi> Moſt true; not improbable only but meerely impoſſible, the Catholique Church ſhould bee without Charity. Far be it from vs to lay this vnjuſt and vnworthy charge vpon our deere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Catholique Church. Charity is the ligament which connects both that whole myſticall Body vnto Chriſt her glorious Head, and each ſeuerall member one to another. The good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth and loue ever aſſiſts and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that great Body. This Mother of all Chriſtians we honour as her dutifull Children, and are well aſſured of her bleſſing. We accuſe not Her for want of Charity (ſhee giues no cauſe:) but that proud and curſt Dame of Rome, who takes vpon her to revell in the Houſe of God, to let in and caſt out at her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, pretending that ſhee alone is the Mother and Miſtris in that Houſe, vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and confining all the priviledges of the Catholique Church to her ſelfe alone.

Briefly the Vnity of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique is not hindred by any diverſity of opinions, or obſervations in her ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall members; ſo long as the ſubſtance of faith, and the bond of Charity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued among them.</p>

               <p>Every terme is ambiguous; and therefore the whole propoſition true or falſe, as it may be limited. Salvation may be had either by the ordinary meanes, or extraordinarily. The Church notes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Catholique, or Particulars. Hee may be in the one, who is outed by the others: and an interiour Communion may be without the externall. A Church may teach many truths, and ſo farre bee true: yet by the addition of many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and abuſes become in regard of them a falſe Church. And it may be one in the faith, which is not at one (either with it ſelfe or other particulars) in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

               <p>Like Inſtances might be numberleſſe. By all which it is cleare, that, of old, a totall Communion with the Church of Rome (euen in her good dayes) was not accounted ſo precious and neceſſary, as is now pretended. On the contrary, men generally beleeued, that Chriſtians might liue and dye in the peace of God, though they were at warre with the Pope; and keepe the vnity of the Church Catholique, though they fell off or were cut off from that of Rome.</p>

               <p>If now the Miſtaker will ſuppoſe his Romane Church and Religion purged from theſe and the like confeſſed exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and nouelties: hee ſhall finde in that which remaines little difference of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, betweene vs.</p>
               <p>But by this diſcourſe the Miſtaker happily may beleeue his cauſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantaged, and may reply. If Rome want nothing eſſentiall to Religion or to a Church, how then can the Reformers juſtifie their ſeparation from that Church, or free themſelues from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Schiſme? For ſurely to ſeparate from the communion of the Church, without juſt and neceſſary cauſe, is a Schiſme very damnable.</p>
               <p>All this in effect is formerly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27596:50"/>
Yet to ſatisfie our Miſtaker, (if it may be) we will here further ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the point, more plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
               <p>There neither was, nor can be any juſt cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt; no more then from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But to depart from a Particular Church, and namely from the Church of Rome, in ſome doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, there might be juſt and neceſſary cauſe; though the Church of Rome wanted nothing neceſſary to ſaluation. I ſaid <hi>ſignantèr,</hi> in ſome doctrines and practiſes. For there is great difference betweene a Schiſme from them, and a Reformation of our ſelues: And it is one thing to leaue the communion of the Church of Rome, another to leaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with her in her errors.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer profeſſes himſelfe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the communion of any one member of the body of Chriſt, muſt confeſſe himſelfe conſequently to forſake the whole. And therefore her communion we forſake not, no more then the Body of Chriſt, whereof we acknowledge the Church of Rome a member, though
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27596:50"/>

Nay our Charity reaches fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to all thoſe at this day, who in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart beleeue the Romane Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and profeſſe it. But we vnderſtand onely thoſe, who either haue not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes to finde the truth; or elſe ſuch as after the vſe of the beſt meanes they can haue, all things conſidered, finde not ſufficient motiues to conuince their conſcience that they are in errour, But they that haue vnderſtanding and meanes to diſcouer their errour, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to vſe them; wee dare not flatter them with ſo eaſie a cenſure. And much leſſe them, that dare profeſſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church of Rome, when they doe not beleeue it, or onely beleeue
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:27596:52"/>
it, becauſe ſome carnall or worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect doth blinde or miſleade their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to that demand of our Romaniſts, <hi>If we beleeue their Religion to be a ſafe way to heauen, why doe we not follow it?</hi> We anſwer, we beleeue it ſafe, that is, by Gods great mercy not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſome, ſuch as beleeue what they profeſſe: but we beleeue it not ſafe, but very dangerous if not certainly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſuch as profeſſe it when they beleeue, (or, if their hearts were vpright and not peruerſly obſtinate might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) the contrary. The Ieſuires and Dominicans hold different opinions touching predetermination, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate conception of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: Yet ſo, that the Ieſuite holds the Dominicans way ſafe, that is his error not damnable, and the Dominicans hold the ſame of the Ieſuites. Yet neither of them with good conſequence can preſſe the other to beleeue his opinion, becauſe by his owne confeſſion it is no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errour. For as the Dominicans might vrge the Ieſuites after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo the Ieſuites might returne it vpon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27596:52"/>
the Dominicans: and ſo the Argument being common to both, either it muſt conclude for both, (and ſo both parts of a contradiction muſt be true;) or elſe, (which is moſt certaine and euident,) it concludes for neither. And if for neither of them againſt the other, then by the like reaſon it is vaine for Papiſts to vſe it againſt Proteſtants. All falſe opinions are not damnable errours, to them that beleeue them: yet may they be ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe, that there can be no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in beleeuing them. If one ſhould beleeue, that twice two were not foure, all would confeſſe he held no damnable errour: But if the ſame man ſhould thinke all men bound in conſcience to be of his opinion, and vrge them (as the Romaniſts doe vs) that, by their owne confeſſion there were no danger in his way, and therefore in wiſedome they were to follow it; who would not laugh at his ridiculous folly? So if they haue no better ground of their beleefe, then their Aduerſaries charitable judgement of their errours, they will be ſo farre from conuincing their Aduerſaries of lacke of wiſedome, that themſelues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27596:53"/>
eſcape the imputation of folly.</p>
               <p>By all this it is euident, that although we confeſſe the Church of Rome to be (in ſome ſence) a true Church, and her errours to ſome men not damnable: yet for vs who are conuinced in conſcience, that ſhe erres in many things; a neceſſity lyes vpon vs, euen vnder paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to forſake her in thoſe errours. Which is not ſo much a forſaking of her, as a purging of our ſelues. To cleanſe ſome part of the Church from vile abuſes, is not to goe out of the Church. If a Monaſtery ſhould reforme it ſelfe, and reduce into practiſe ancient good diſcipline, when others would not; in this caſe, could it with reaſon bee charged with Schiſme from others, or with Apoſtacy from its rule and order. Or as in a Society of men vniuerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free themſelues from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſe, could not be therefore ſaid to ſeparate from the Society: So neither can the Reformed Churches (eſpecially ours of England) be truly accuſed for making a Schiſme from the Church, ſeeing all they did, was to reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27596:53"/>
yet with reſolution, to continue in communion (as much as in them lay,) euen with thoſe parts of the Church, that would not doe ſo. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if they of Rome could firſt make it appeare by any ſound proofe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Church was pure and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no Reformation; or that it is all one to leaue the communion of the Church, and to ceaſe communicating with ſome Churches in their errours; or laſtly, that it is all one to forſake the Church of Rome and to forſake the obedience to that Church as it is now required; then the crime of Schiſme might with ſome colour be laid to our charge. But all theſe are groundleſſe aſſumptions, talk'd of very freely and commonly, but ſuch as neuer will be proued by any one Argument of validity.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, wee can neuer be joyned with Rome, in ſuch corruptions as make her Popiſh: But wee were neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from her in thoſe maine eſſentiall truthes, which giue her the name and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a Church.

No doubt, the errors of Poperie, and thoſe other of Vbiquitie, Conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the like, are errours groſſe and palpable: yet not ſuch as preſently and abſolutely cut off all, that profeſſe and beleeue them, from the Catholique Church and all hope of Saluation; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if withall they profeſſe reſolutely and heartily to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, and to obey him according to his word ſo farre as they can vnderſtand it, or can be taught it. For howſoeuer ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diſputant by Logicall deduction may from thoſe opinions inferre ſome conſequences damnable and deſtructiue to the Faith: yet the erring perſons many times doe not ſee or beleeue that any ſuch conſequences follow clearly from their opinions; nay they doe (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily) ſo farre abhorre them and are ſo well diſpoſed towards truth, that rather then admit any ſuch dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, they would readily renounce and rectifie their opinions.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was a peaceable and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt man; diſſented from others in his judgement but without any breach of Charity; condemned no man (much leſſe any Church) for the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. He beleeued his owne Opinion to be true, but beleeued not that it was neceſſarie, and therefore did not proceed raſhly and peremptorily to cenſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but left them to their libertie: and finally, he had a teachable and tractable minde, willing to alter his Opinion if hee had ſeene reaſon, and to yeeld to Truth if it had beene cleared vnto him, or if hee had liued to heare the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nicene Fathers.

pretending that the judgement and practiſe of former Agesought not to be altered, that this releaſing of ſevere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline would open a gap to vice and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, that the Church had no power to reconcile or receiue into her ſociety ſuch enormious Sinners though penitent, that if ſhe did, ſhe was polluted by their communion. And vpon theſe pretences, they breake out into a formall Schiſme and ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, many good Catholique Biſhops were of the ſame opinion with the Donatiſts, that the Baptiſme of Heretiques was ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; and with the Novatians, that the Church ought not to abſolue ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sinners. Theſe errours therefore (if they had gone no farther) were not in themſelues Hereticall, eſpecially in the proper and moſt heavy or bitter ſenſe of that word; neither was it in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches intention (or in her power) to make them ſuch by her Declaration. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to ſilence all diſputes and to ſettle peace and vnity in her governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to which all wiſe and peaceable

men ſubmitted, whatſoever their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was. And thoſe factious people, for their vnreaſonable and vncharitable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, were very juſtly branded for Schiſmatiques.</p>

               <p>3. They teach that the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſiſted in her propoſalls and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſo as ſhe cannot erre. And this dreame hath made Rome ſenceleſſe of her errours and careles to ſeek any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, nay utterly incapable of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For, to mindes really poſſeſſed with this fond perſuaſion and prejudice,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27596:84"/>
the moſt convincing reaſons, the moſt plaine Scriptures, the moſt pregnant authorities of Fathers, which proue the Church of Rome may erre, or hath erred, are all loſt and made ineffectuall: and ſeeme not ſtrong arguments of the truth, but ſtrong temptations againſt it. And this imagination of their Churches infallibility, is to them at once both a ſufficient reaſon of what is moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and a ſufficient anſwer for what is moſt unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>That the Church is infallible we do not abſolutely deny: wee only deny the Church to be abſolutely infallible. Some of the moſt able Writers of the Roman partie do ſo fairly limit this priviledge, that in their ſence we do without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty admit it. Their limitation is double, regarding 1. the ſubject of this infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, 2. the object of it.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27596:85"/>
But in the ſecond he yeelds, that the Church may ſometimes erre, either in her diſcourſes, or in her concluſions; &amp; that without any violation of Chriſts promiſe made to the Church for infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie. And of this aſſertion He giues diverſe good reaſons.

A ſecond reaſon He addes, taken from the office of the Church after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which <hi>is not to make new Articles of faith, but onely to conſigne and deliver thoſe which ſhe hath received.</hi> Thus D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>Briefly, their meaning is, (&amp; ours is the ſame) that the whole Militant Church (that is, all the members of it,) cannot poſſibly erre, either in the whole faith, or any neceſſary article of it. For ſuch an errour muſt needs diſ-unite all the members from Chriſt the Head; and ſo

diſſolue the Body, and leaue him no Church, which is impoſſible. Chriſt ever hath had, and ever ſhall haue a true Church on earth: now a true Church is all one with a Church not erring in the foundation.</p>

                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> to the <hi>whole Church;</hi> which is never ſo far forſaken by Chriſt that it ſhould utterly forſake and fall off from him. But the faith of the Church cannot be totally corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Eſſentialls of it, or aboliſhed; yet may it be foulely infected with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vile and unworthy additions, though not with direct repugnancies.</p>
               <p>In theſe promiſes then there is no foundation to ſupport that very vaine and vaſte pretenſion of the Church of Rome: who challenges to her ſelfe an abſolute and univerſall infallibility in all her propoſalls. For neither do theſe promiſes principally reſpect the Church of Rome, and more then the Church of Corinth, Epheſus, or the like, any further or longer then ſuch parts do cleaue and conſent to the whole bodie and Spouſe of Chriſt: nor hath the Church Univerſall the like aſſurance from Chriſt that ſhe ſhall not erre in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary additions, as ſhe hath for her not erring in taking away from the faith what is fundamentall and neceſſarie. Its comfort enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will ſecure her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27596:88"/>
from all capitall dangers, and conſerve her on earth againſt all enemies: but ſhe may not hope to triumph over all ſinne and error, till ſhe be in heaven. Hay and ſtubble and ſuch unprofitable ſtuffe, laid on the roofe, deſtroyes not the houſe, whilſt the maine pillars are ſtanding on the foundation. The Giant in <hi>Gath,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 20. was a true man, though much deformed with ſuperfluous fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and toes; but if one looſe any vitall part, he is a man no longer. There is not ſo much danger in adding ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, as in detracting what is eſſentiall and neceſſarie. That the Church ſhall never be rob'd of any truth, neceſſarie to the being of the Church, the promiſes of Chriſt aſſure us: But that to neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie truths, ſhe ſhall adde no unneceſſarie opinions; for that we have no warrant, either from the Scripture, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God. And were it otherwiſe, the Doctors above mentioned had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the Churches cauſe, in ſtead of maintaining it. For if in all her doctrines and definitions ſhe be infallible, why ſhould they reſtraine her infallibilitie in defining unto matters <hi>neceſſary?</hi> They
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27596:88"/>
ſhould have profeſs'd her roundly and plainly infallible in <hi>all</hi> her determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For to limit her infallibility in defining, onely to things neceſſary; and then to ſay that all defin'd by her, is <hi>eo ipſo</hi> neceſſarie becauſe defin'd, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the world, and ſeemingly to yeild ſomething when nothing is yeilded.</p>
               <p>The Romane cauſe at this day (as it appeares by the vulgar Writers of the Popes quarter, and, among others, by our Miſtaker,) wholly depends on this pretended abſolute infallibility. All Controverſies in the iſſue are reduced to this, and decided by it. And with great reaſon, if there were any reaſon in it, or for it. For if Rome cannot erre or be deceived, then without doubt all they erre and are deceived, who diſſent from her. And therefore, me thinkes, learned men of that partie, might do very well to eaſe themſelves and the world of much trouble and paines, in the ſcanning of other queſtions; if with all their ſtrength and witt they can but ſettle on the Pope or his adherents ſuch an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, by any one convicting argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this will inſtantly and evidently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27596:89"/>
conclude all our other differences. No wiſe man will any way contradict them, who cannot any way erre.</p>
               <p>But ſurely this doctrine, that the Church is infallible in all her definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is ſo far from being certaine and divine, that it is at the beſt but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and problematicall; and that even by, and from their owne principles.</p>
               <p>The Roman D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> deliver us theſe Maximes concerning the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 1. <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>untill a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be declared or defined by the Church, ſo long it may be either doubted of, or denyed without danger.</hi> Theſe propoſitions are their owne. Hence wee aſſume: But this doctrine <hi>[that the Church is infallible in all her decrees and definitions]</hi> was never yet declared, decreed or defined by the Church, no not by any Councell, or by any Pope. And hence we inferre;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27596:89"/>
Therefore it is a doctrine which may be doubted of, or denyed without danger; a doctrine which no man can beleeue by divine faith; a doctrine (whatſoever it be in it ſelfe) to Chriſtians not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If any man will deny the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will oblige himſelfe to diſproue it by a contrary inſtance: Let it be ſhewed where, and when, and in what termes the Church hath publiſhed any ſuch declaration. And ſuppoſe (which will not be granted) that ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had beene made, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with reaſon, upon what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Church can aſſume to her ſelfe a power ſo divine and boundleſſe, as to authorize all her decrees in ſo high a forme, that they muſt be accounted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and infallible? If the promiſe of God in Scripture be pleaded for this power, we haue already ſhewed how the learned among themſelues haue voyded this plea, and ſo reſtrained thoſe promiſes that they are by much too narrow to ſupport ſo wide a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If it bee ſaid that this authority of the Church is a principle admitted by all Chriſtians without any doubt or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27596:90"/>
proofe, this is a ſaying voluntary and and groundleſſe. For 1. they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe every principle in Religion to be founded either in nature, or in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in tradition, or in Church defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and in none of theſe will they find any footing for this. 2. All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world confeſſe the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Scripture, to be a principle inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable; yet are we by them perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually urged to proue that authority, and that by Scripture. 3.

                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> thinkes it not onely fitting, but <hi>neceſſary, in reſpect of us, that the Church ſhould give teſtimony to her ſelf:</hi> eſpecially the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in this point of ſo great importance &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning her infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherein all Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. 4. Laſtly, it is a great errour and vanitie to beleeue, that this abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church is beleeved by all Chriſtians: eſpecially in the ſence of our Adverſaries, who ever by the Church intend that unſound piece, which they call the Roman Catholique. The Proteſtants and Greekes, expreſly accuſe this Church (and haue convicted her too, as they thinke,) of many groſſe

               <p>Before wee proceed, it will not be from our purpoſe, to note one thing more in paſſing. The Church of Rome pretends, that it is an office belonging onely to Her, to deliver the entire <hi>rule of faith</hi> to all Chriſtian people. And ſhe pretends further that this divine and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27596:91"/>
infalliable rule is made up of three inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall parts; to wit, <hi>Scriptures, Traditions,</hi> and <hi>Church definitions.</hi> If this be true, ſhe doth but looſely diſcharge her office, &amp; very ill ſatisfie the obligation which ſhe hath unto the Chriſtian world. For 1. Why hath ſhe not yet defined that her definitions are of divine authority? The late Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> haue canonized unwritten traditions, and equall'd them to Scriptures; but why did they omit to canonize the decrees of all Popes, &amp; Councells? Why did they not adde to Traditions, their Church definitions, and command them both, and them all to be received with <hi>no leſſe devotion then the holy Scriptures.</hi> 2. The ſame Fathers have given us an exact catalogue of all the bookes of Scripture: but why did they not give us the like liſt of divine and infallible Traditions? Is it becauſe they are numberles and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted? Or becauſe it may be a thing full of danger to confine them to any certaine number, leaſt ſome be omitted? Or becauſe they are not yet agreed which are divine Traditions? Or is it (as Dr. <note n="y" place="margin">Defenſ. au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Eccleſ. l. 1 cap. 2. §. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> excuſes his Church
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27596:91"/>
on the like occaſion) becauſe <hi>that Church hath not yet throughly weighed all her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, either for want of opportunity, or by reaſon of other thoughts &amp; diſtractions</hi> which have not permitted her ſeriouſly to conſider of this buſines? But there cannot be a buſines of greater moment in Religion, or more worthy of the Churches care, then to deliver the rule of truth clearely and preciſely, by which all doctrines in the Church are to be ſquared and examined. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of Rome herein ſo careleſſe, cannot be excuſed from ſupine negligence.</p>
               <p>Now to returne from this ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. So far as truth and reaſon will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, we have yeelded an infallibility to the Church: That is, infallibility in the Eſſentialls of faith, to the Church Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall. And this confeſſion ſatisfies the beſt of our Adverſaries, who demand no more.</p>
               <p>But when our Miſtaker talkes ſo often of the infallibility and ſupreme judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, He meanes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what els by <hi>the Church.</hi> Though, ſurely, he knowes not well what he meanes;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27596:92"/>
or at leaſt will not be forward to let us know his meaning; whether he meanes the <hi>Church repreſentative,</hi> which is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, or the <hi>Church virtuall,</hi> which is the Pope; in whether of the two he plants this infallibility, as in the Proper Subject, it will perplex him to ſay; and whatſoever he ſay he ſhall touch a ſore, and find ſtrong oppoſition within his owne partie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>Generall Councells,</hi> we give them all the reſpect which is due unto them, and much more then do the moſt of our Adverſaries. We ſay, that ſuch Generall Councells, as are lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and proceed orderly, are great and awfull repreſentations of the Church Catholique; that they are the higheſt externall Tribunall which the Church hath on earth; that their authority is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately derived and delegated from Chriſt; that no Chriſtian is exempted from their cenſures or juriſdiction; that their decrees bind all perſons to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obedience, &amp; may not be queſtioned but upon evident reaſon, nor reverſed but by an equall authority; that if they be carefull and diligent in the uſe of all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27596:92"/>
good meanes for finding out the truth, it is very probable the good Spirit will ſo direct them, that they ſhall not erre, at leaſt not fundamentally. But they are not abſolutely freed from all error. Such a Councell is but an aſſembly of men, and thoſe ſometimes not of the moſt able and ſufficient. The Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall may have many more able members, out of the Councell, then ſhe hath in it. For though that repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting body, have all the legall power or binding ſtrength of the whole, yet it hath not all the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power or wiſedome which is in the whole. The Catholique Church cannot poſſibly communicate her ſtrength or power in that kind to any Councell. Yet ſuppoſe the beſt of men to be in that meeting; even they are but men when all is done, neither all of them equall in the endowments of nature or grace, nor any of them perfect, being every one ſubject to all the infirmities and paſſions which attend our nature. Their meeting then cannot make them infallible in all things; though the act that is hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by ſo many heads, muſt needs in reaſon be perfecter, then that which is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27596:93"/>
the iſſue of one mans ſufficiencie.</p>
               <p>But happily they are infallibly aſſiſted! No doubt, the holy infallible Spirit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts at all ſuch holy meetings; but how <note place="margin">Math. 18. 20.</note> far, or in what manner, is all the doubt. The good Spirit ever aſſiſts the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the devout and diligent, ſo far as is neceſſarie: and is ready to guide them that are deſirous to be guided by him. But his guidance is not a violent rapture, or a wild <hi>Enthuſiaſme;</hi> but in ſearches of truth He ever directs us to the infallible rule of truth, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And it is poſſible that a Generall Councell may miſapply, or miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or neglect that rule, weakly or wilfully; and ſo erre, notwithſtanding the Spirits aſſiſtance.

Yet further: if <hi>S.

And he was not truly baptized, or ordained, if the Biſhop ordaining him, or the Prieſt baptizing him, (or any other who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly baptized or ordained them) fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their intention. And whether they did ſo faile, neither <hi>Vrban</hi> himſelfe nor any man elſe can be aſſured, no not by an humane certainty, much leſſe by a divine faith. How then, is our Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſure that his Pope is the infallible Head of the Church, when he cannot be ſure that he is a member of it?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, admit the Pope infallible in his definitions, yet how can any Papiſt in Europe (excepting onely thoſe few that ſtand by and heare his Holines when he gives out his Oracles,) be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſure what it is which he hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27596:100"/>
defined? Their aſſurance hereof is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much faith as they can give to the reports of their Prieſts and Jeſuites: which at the beſt can produce in them but a ſtrong opinion, unleſſe they can beleeve their Prieſts and Jeſuites alſo to be infallible in their relations.</p>
               <p>It much concernes our Miſtaker, and all Roman Catholiques to conſider, how feeble and wavering that faith muſt be which is concluded from theſe ſlippery principles. Every lawfull Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome is infallible, but <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is lawfull Biſhop of Rome, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is infallible. And then againe. Whatſoever <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. defines is infallibly true, but this or that <hi>Vrban</hi> hath defined, therfore it is infallibly true. In theſe Syllogiſines imagine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to be certain &amp; true, (as they are moſt certainly falſe,) yet the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a very Roman Catholique, at the moſt can be but probable, he cannot be certaine of either. Not certaine that <hi>Vrban</hi> was lawfully ordained, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into the chaire; nor certaine that out of his chaire he hath publiſhed this or that definition. An opinion or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27596:100"/>
of theſe things he may haue; but he cannot haue certainty, and much leſſe divine faith. Wherefore, ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion cannot be ſtronger then the weaker of the Premiſſes, his faith is not divine nor certaine, but onely a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or an opinion. Unleſſe happily he can comfort himſelfe with that witty invention of Cardinall <note n="n" place="margin">

               <p>We may now conclude this point, and returne our Miſtakers words upon himſelfe.

with that; and was ſo curious as with his owne hand to correct many errors eſcaped in the Preſſe, becauſe he would have it more compleat. This Bible was publiſhed with the Popes Declaration before it, the yeare 1590. a Copy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is extant (though they have conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many as they could) in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Library of Oxford. <hi>Clement</hi> 8. ſhortly after, obſerving many defects and corruptions in that Edition, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another, with the very like Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he authoriſes onely his owne Bible, revoking all others.

His Objections are. In the Creed there is no mention. 1. of the Canon of Scripture. 2. or of the number and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacraments. 3. or of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether it be by faith or by works. 4. That <hi>Doctrine of devills,</hi> 1. Tim. 4. 1. forbidding <hi>marriage and meates</hi> is not there condemned. 5. Laſtly, the ſence of diverſe Articles is queſtioned, as that of the Deſcent into hell, and the other of the Catholique Church. Therefore the Creed is no perfect rule of faith.</p>

               <p>To the firſt. The Creed is an abſtract or abridgement of ſuch neceſſary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as are delivered in Scripture, or collected out of it; and therefore needs not expreſſe the authority of that which it ſuppoſes. Theſe Articles are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are proved by Scripture; the Scripture it ſelf a principle, which needs no proofe amongſt Chriſtians. The Creed containes onely the <hi>materiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of faith, or the things which muſt be beleived expreſſely according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: The Scripture is further the <hi>formall object of faith,</hi> or the motive and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27596:125"/>
ground whereupon faith is founded; being (as Philoſophers ſay of light in regard of the ſight,) both the <hi>objectum quod,</hi> in reſpect of the things therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; and <hi>objectum quo,</hi> in reſpect of that divine verity and authority which reveales them. Although the Nicene Fathers in their Creed confeſſing that the <hi>holy Ghoſt ſpake by the Prophets,</hi> do thereby ſufficiently avow the divine Authority of all Canonicall Scripture.</p>
               <p>To the 2. we ſay 1. That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be reckoned rather among the <hi>Agenda</hi> of the Church, then the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda:</hi> they are rather divine rites and ceremonies, then doctrines. 2.

Catholique. <hi>Takeing the word Sacrament properly, S. Auguſtin ſaith there are but two, to wit Baptiſme and the Lords Supper. And it is a common ſaying among us Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, that all the Sacraments flowed from the ſide of our Lord. Now there came from his ſide onely bloud and water; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented (according to the interpretation of Chryſoſtome, Cyrill and others of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,) the two Sacraments of the Church; Baptiſme by water, and the Chalice in the Euchariſt by bloud. To which our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctors give no other anſwer; but that theſe two Sacraments, by reaſon of their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are ſpecially ſo called: which is all one to ſay, that there are onely two principall Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many inferiours, which is the very thing which is ſaid by the Huguenots in other termes. They ſay there are but two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and we ſay there are but two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally: Againe we ſay there are many infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Sacraments, and they yeeld it if the name Sacrament be taken in a generall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

               <p>For concluſion of this diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Fundamentalls, I will propound to the conſideration and cenſure of the judicious, theſe thoughts following.</p>
               <p>It ſeemes fundamentall to the faith,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:27596:130"/>
and for the ſalvation of every member of the Church, that he acknowledge &amp; beleeue all ſuch points of faith, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may be ſufficiently convinced that they belong to the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. For he that being ſufficiently convinced doth oppoſe, is obſtinate, an Heretique, and finally ſuch a one as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes himſelfe out of heaven, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no wilfull ſinner can enter.</p>
               <p>Now that a man may be ſufficiently convinced, there are three things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 1. Cleare revelation, 2. Sufficient propoſition, 3. Capacity and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to apprehend what is reveiled and propounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Revelation</hi> from God is required: for we are not bound to beleeue any thing as Gods word, which God hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be his word, and that in ſuch cleare manner, as may convince a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man that it is from God. For want of this, not onely the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, but even Chriſts owne Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are excuſed from being guilty of any damnable errour, though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not the death, reſurrection, or aſcenſion of our Lord: as it is plaine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:27596:130"/>
they did not. <hi>Marc. 16. 11. 13. Luk. 24. 11. Ioh. 20. 9. Marc.</hi> 9. 10. But now that theſe things are ſo clearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled in Scripture, he were no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that ſhould deny them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sufficient propoſition</hi> of reveiled truths is required, before a man can be convinced. For if they be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me, in reſpect of me it is all one as if they were not reveiled. This propoſition includeth 2 things. 1. that the points be perſpicuouſly laid open in themſelves, for want of this <hi>Apollos</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not ſome points of the faith, till he was further informed. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 25. 2. that the ſaid points be ſo fully and forcibly laid open, as may ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move reaſonable doubts to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to ſatisfie a teachable minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the principles, in which he hath beene bred to the contrary. For want of this, the Apoſtles believed not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when yet they were plainely told of it. See <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 44. 45. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 10. compared with <hi>Marc.</hi> 8. 31. 32.</p>
               <p>Note here (1). This propoſition of reveiled truths is not, as the Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſaith, by the infallible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27596:131"/>
of Pope or Church, but by whatſoever meanes a man may be convinced in conſcience of divine revelation. If a Preacher doe cleare any point of faith to his Hearers, if a private Chriſtian doe make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to his neighbour, that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or point of faith is delivered by divine revelation of Gods word; if a man himſelfe (without any other teacher,) by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them read, be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth of any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: this is a <hi>ſufficient propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to prove him that gain ſayeth any ſuch truth to be an Heretique, and obſtinate oppoſer of the faith. Such a one may be truly ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, condemned by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. v. g. He that ſhould read in Scriptures, <hi>Now is Chriſt riſen from the dead</hi>—1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. or, <hi>The word was made fleſh. Ioh.</hi> 1.—and yet ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſts Reſurrection or Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he were an Heretique, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny determination or ſentence of the Church. And ſuch Heretiques there were many in the Primitiue Church
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:27596:131"/>
fore any Councell was celebrated, and long before any Pope preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Infallibility.</p>
               <p>(2) Note. A man may be truly thought thus convicted, not onely when his Conſcience doth <hi>expreſſely</hi> beare witneſſe to the truth, but when <hi>virtually</hi> it doth ſo, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely doe it, if it were not choked or blinded by ſome unruly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified luſt in the will. For if a man make himſelfe a ſlave to ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, covetouſneſſe, vaineglory, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, &amp;c. theſe untamed paſſions will not onely draw the man to profeſſe what he thinketh not, but to thinke what he would diſ-avow, if in ſynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he ſought the truth. And in this caſe the difference is not great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him that is wilfully blinde, <note place="margin">24. qu. 3. §. 28. Haereticus eſt.</note> and him that knowingly gainſayeth the truth.</p>
               <p>(3) Note. A man may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced either in <hi>foro exterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> or in <hi>foro interiori.</hi> In the former he is convinced, who by an orderly proceeding of the Church is cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and condemned: and ſuch a one
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27596:132"/>
                  <hi>ad omnem effectum juris,</hi> and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the ſaid Church, is to be reputed an heretique, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Cenſure be erroneous. He that is convicted in the later kinde, is an Heretique before God, though no authority of the Church have dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or proceeded againſt him. And this conviction onely is neceſſary to prove one an Heretique excluded from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is required <hi>capacity or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wit</hi> and reaſon to apprehend that which is cleerly revealed and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propoſed. For want of this, not onely fooles and mad men are excuſed, but thoſe who are of weaker capacity or leſſe knowledge may be excuſed from beleiving of thoſe things which they cannot apprehend: as the Apoſtles are by Chriſt Ioh. 16. 12.</p>
               <p>But where there is no ſuch impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as hath been ſaid, &amp; the revealed will or word of God is ſufficiently propounded; there he that oppoſeth is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced of error, &amp; he who is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced is an Heretique, and <hi>Hereſie</hi> is a worke of the fleſh which <hi>excludeth from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27596:132"/>
heaven.</hi> Gal. 5. 20. 21. And hence it followeth, that it is fundamentall to a Chriſtians faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he beleive all reveiled truths of God, whereof he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are from God.</p>
               <p>The cavills of the Miſtaker againſt the Church of England and her Articles (in this matter) are eaſily anſwered.</p>
               <p>When the Church of England had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly reformed her ſelfe: ſhe was loudly accuſed (by the Romane faction) of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Schiſme; (as it hath been, in later ages, the cunning cuſtome of Rome to blaſt and diſgrace all them that dared to oppoſe any of her corrupt opinions or uſages.) Wherefore, to cleare her innocency, Shee publiſhed to the world a Declaration of her judgement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which we call her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Wherin her aime was not, in any curious method, to deliver a Syſteme of Divinity: but plainly, without fraud or artifice, to ſet downe, firſt the poſitive principles of her faith, or the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls of it, wherein ſhe hath ſufficiently declared her ſelfe, both in <note n="a" place="margin">Aro. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.—8.—</note> moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and in ſumme by <note n="b" place="margin">Art. 8.</note> avowing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27596:133"/>
the Catholique Creeds,) and then a rejection of ſuch errors (eſpecially Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh) as She judged to be without ground of Scripture, reaſon or Antiquity. Now Popery is not any univocall part or member in the body of Divinity: it is onely an <hi>Apoſteme</hi> gathered of corrupt and heterogeneous matter. All the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in the world cannot poſſibly range ſuch a confuſed lumpe of falſities into any certaine or diſtinct method. And therefore if the Declaration of our Church againſt theſe errors be <hi>extremely confuſed,</hi> as our Miſtaker pretends; the cauſe is in the errors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, wherein there is nothing but extreme confuſion. By the other part of his charge, that <hi>our Church in divers points ſpeaks obſcurely, and not home to the queſtion,</hi> it is evident that he doth not well underſtand himſelfe or thoſe points, wherein he gives inſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That particular Churches (and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his) have erred,</hi> our Church beleives and <note n="c" place="margin">Art. 19.</note> profeſſes; and we beleive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any particular Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume She cannot fall by error, She is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len already by pride. That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church can erre in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27596:133"/>
our Church beleives not and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 2.</note> profeſſes not. But by the <hi>infallible Church,</hi> I doubt not, the man meanes that which they call the <hi>Romane Catholique;</hi> for it is the perpetuall and palpable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſme of the Faction to confound the Romane and the Catholique, and to argue from this to that; as if all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Catholique Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed onely to the Roman quarter.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, it is not denyed that the true Catholique Church is alwaies viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cannot be hid. And whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a Congregation of men, that profeſſe and deſire to honour the true God, <hi>Calling upon the name of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours,</hi> and beleiving the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament; there (as very <note n="*" place="margin">Vide ſupra pag. 111.</note> Learned men are of opinion) is a true Chriſtian Church, wherein ſalvation may be had, and a viſible member of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.

               <p>In the point of Freewill, our Church profeſſes (withall Catholique Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Greeke and Latine, before and after <hi>Pelagius,)</hi> that though the Will be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and eſſentially free from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and neceſſiity, yet it is not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually free from ſinne, or to any good, untill it be freed by inward ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and undeſerved Grace; which both prevets, prepares &amp; excites the Will to every good act that it may be helped, &amp; then helpes it when it is prepared. That the Will <hi>of it ſelfe</hi> hath no power to any good act, till it be thus quickned, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and aſſiſted by Grace, which in all good workes and deſires is the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall agent,</hi> to which the Will is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27596:135"/>
But that this grace corrects and perfects nature, doth not aboliſh it. Wherefore the Will being mooved by grace as aforeſaid, is not idle but freely moves it ſelfe to conſent, having ſtill a naturall and corrupt liberty to ſinne. So as all the good we doe (or have or hope for) muſt be aſcribed to God and his free grace, and all the ſinne we doe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wholly to our own will and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And by this doctrine, we fully avoide and contradict the two contrary errors, of the Manichees on the one ſide, who deny the <hi>naturall</hi> liberty of the Will, and of the Pelagians and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques on the other ſide, who give the will a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> liberty <hi>of it ſelfe,</hi> and ſo deny the neceſſity of preventing grace. If ſome Proteſtant Writers goe farther <note place="margin">Piſcator, &amp;c.</note> in this point, ſo farre as to affirme that God determines and neceſſitates the Wills of men to every act, good or bad, naturall, morall or ſpirituall, ſo as the motion of Providence or grace leaves no power or poſſibility in the Will actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to diſſent <hi>(in ſenſu compoſito:)</hi> Anſw. 1. this is nothing to the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which approves not this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

doctrine. 2. The Miſtaker cannot with reaſon or modeſty upbraid them (much leſſe others) with this opinion or the ill conſequents of it; ſince no Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt (as he calls them) herein ſpeaks more harſhly or rigorouſly then his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, <hi>Bannes, Alvarez, Zumel, Ledeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Herrera, Nugnus, Navarrete,</hi> &amp; many others; for proofe whereof I referre him to a late <note n="f" place="margin">Apell. pro Dom.
